# restaurant-page

### The goals of this project:

  - Make a single page restaurant app, that tabs through the various sections without loading.
  - Work with ES6 modules
  - Render all DOM elements dynamically
  - Utilize webpack to bundle the modules
  - As always, get some CSS practice in
  
  
 ### Reflection
 
 ES6 modules make development so much streamline. The scripts of my other projects are very much frankensteined together.
 Rendering out of the DOM elements with vanilla Javascript was quite annoying. I'm excited to get started with React,
 as I'm sure it solves some of the headache I was dealing with. It's good to start learning webpack early, but wow,
 is it overwhelming at first. 
 
 Overall, I feel pretty good about how it turned out. These things never feel done, but
 in the future I would like to rebuild the whole thing in React and hook it up to a backend. 
 I also think it needs a much better design.
